                        <li>If an angle is inscribed in a circle, then the measure of the angle equals 
                            one-half the measure of its intercepted arc (or the measure of the 
                            intercepted arc is twice the measure of the inscribed angle).</li>
                        <li>If two inscribed angles of a circle (or congruent circles) intercept congruent 
                            arcs or the same arc, then the angles are congruent.</li>
                        <li>If an inscribed angle of a circle intercepts a semicircle, then the angle is a 
                            right angle.</li>
                        <li>If a quadrilateral is inscribed in a circle, then its opposite angles are 
                            supplementary.</li>
